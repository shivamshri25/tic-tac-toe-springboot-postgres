Tic Tac Toe Game implementation using Spring Boot with PostgreSQL database

# about-the-app
The application is a simple implementation of the tic-tac-toe game between 2 players on a 3 X 3 board. The first player can create a game and the second player can connect to the game or to any game from existing games in the database. The gameplay is pretty simple with both the players placing "X" and "O" symbols in the different squares of the grid and the winner is the one who successfully makes a linear/diagonal progression with the same symbol. The game ends up as a draw in case no winner is decided after completion of all the suares of the grid.
